# F1-prediction-ML-model
This project implements a machine learning pipeline in Python to predict race outcomes using structured real-world data. It covers the full data science workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

The model is trained on historical performance data and learns patterns that influence competitive outcomes. The project focuses on building a reproducible, well-structured workflow for supervised learning, from raw data to validated predictions.

The repository is designed as an educational and applied data science project, demonstrating practical use of machine learning techniques, data handling, and analytical reasoning.
